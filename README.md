# chatango-lib
Chatango Library for Python 3.8+

First, Special thanks to Sweets, Linkkg(Megamaster12) and [TheClonerx](https://github.com/linkkg/megach.py)

Based on "megach.py", [linkkg](https://github.com/linkkg/) + "CherryBlossom", [Sweets](https://github.com/sweets/) also she motivate me xdd

##### Things to know
The lib is not finished. i will make changes and make optimizations when required
also i want to make some special lib with original content.
so when i can, i will remove the "copied content" and make it myself.
Any question can be [here](https://palaciodehielo.chatango.com/) *en/es*, whatever.

upd: I'm seeing the limit using just one session, thinking about making a version that sets connection per session. 2.0v 
wait for it.
